									<h1>The rise of video streaming services</h1>
									<span class="date">September 24, 2022</span>
									<header>
										<h2>Context</h2>
										</header>
						
									<p>The meteoric rise of video streaming services has displaced traditional, off-the-shelf providers of movies and shows, with no signs of slowing down any time soon. In this project, I explore public listing data across four of the most popular streaming providers and conduct longitudinal analysis over member growth, listings, genres & durations. I report on my findings, observations and key insights in a dynamic dashboard format. 
									<p>The data is sourced, cleansed and managed by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/datasets" target = "_blank">Shivam Bansal (via Kaggle)</a>. The dashboard covers listing data from inception to 2021 for providers Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus and Hulu.
									<p>Some of the key metrics are defined as:
									<ul>
										<li>'Time To Service' - calculated as the difference between [Date that listing was added to platform] and  [Date that listing was released]</li>
										<li>'Parental Ratings' - refers to the 'Motion Picture Film Rating System' and includes rolled-up data points from each platform</li>
										<li>'Duration' (movies) - grouped as 'Short covers 0 to 60 minutes', 'Moderate covers 61 to 120 minutes' and 'Long covers > 121 minutes'</li>
										<li>'Duration (shows)' - grouped as 'Short covers 1 - 3 seasons', 'Moderate covers 4 to 10 seasons' and 'Long covers > 11 seasons'</li>
									</ul>

						<!-- Objective -->
									
									<header>
										<h2>Objectives</h2>
										</header>
									<p>From the analysis, I aim to report on key trends and insights from the listing data in a dynamic and visual manner; allowing users to filter across provider, listing, genre.</p>
						
						<!-- Process -->

										<h2>Process</h2>
									<ol>
										<li>Download the primary listing data in .csv format, covering the four major streaming services (Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime and Hulu)</li>
										<li>Execute the following script in <i><b>MySQL</b></i> to load, cleanse and enrich the raw data:</li>

								<h2>Insights</h2>

							<dl>
								<dt>Listings & Member Growth</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										<li>Video streaming services started to grow in popularity in 2008, when both Netflix and Prime (then known as 'Amazon Instant Video on Demand') introduced the first rendition of their offering to market</li>
										<li>Since then, the number of members across all services has grown consistently to date (up 16% vs 2020, with 34% 10-year CAGR); Hulu and Prime have grown the fastest (44% and 46% 10-year CAGR, respectively), with recent entry Disney Plus capturing member share as well</li>
										<li>Prime and Hulu have increased the number of listings added to their platform, primarily in the last few years and were generally movies as opposed to shows (up 95% vs 2020 for Prime, up 45% for Hulu)</li>
										<li>Netflix has historically relied on licensed content to drive platform growth; and intensified competition from existing providers and new entrants (the likes of Apple TV, HBO Max, Paramount Plus etc.) has impacted the total number of listings and slowed member growth (up 9% vs 2020, after a decade of double digit growth)</li>
										<li>Despite efforts to grow their 'Netflix Original' branding, the number of total listings has plateaued and declined from 2019 (down 15% vs 2020 for shows, down 22% vs 2020 for movies)</li>
									</ul>
								</dd>
								<dt>Genres & Duration</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										<li>Across all providers, the genres 'Drama', 'Action' and 'Comedy' have the most listings in 2021 (up 39%, 58% and 18% vs 2020, respectively)</li>
										<li>Top genres are generally consistent across providers, with the exception of Hulu (who have more documentary-focused listings) and Disney Plus (who have more animations and children shows)</li>
										<li>In recent times, Disney has also added more 'short duration' listings than any other provider - which is consistent with their service offering catered towards younger viewers</li>
									</ul>
								</dd>
								<dt>Time to Service, Rating & Releases</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										<li>The average time to service across providers is 8 years, with Netflix (5) and Hulu (7) existing at the lower side of the spectrum; Disney Plus' time to service (17) is skewed by their late entry to the market and retrospectively adding shows to their platform</li>
										<li>The most common parental rating for listings is PG-13 and the least common is R-18, which true for all providers except:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Prime - where R-18 is the most common rating, likely due to having more international titles in their portfolio; and </li>
												<li>Disney - where PG is the most common rating, once again due to their service offering catered towards younger viewers</li>
