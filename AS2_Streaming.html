									<h1>Temp - Streaming Services Project</h1>
									<span class="date">September 18, 2022</span>
									<header>
										<h2>Context</h2>
										</header>
						
									<p>In this project, I explore and visualise public travel data for NYC yellow cabs in efforts to identify insights around trip seasonality, trip duration & distance and payment methods & tipping across trips. The data is managed by and sourced from the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page" target = "_blank">Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)</a>, who are responsible for licensing and regulating NYC's taxi cabs and limousines. 
									<p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of cabs in NYC:
									<ul>
										<li>Yellow cabs are limited by TLC-issued medallions, have no pick-up restrictions and generally operate within Manhattan city</li>
										<li>Green cabs were introduced in 2013 to improve accessiblity, have pick-up restrictions in yellow cab zones & airports and tend to travel across NY state</li>
									</ul>

									<p>The distinction between cab types is important in our analysis as it dictates where cabs typically operate and where trips can / cannot be taken in. The analyses contains trips made by yellow cabs only and covers the months of February and August 2018 (assumed as Winter and Summer, respectively).</p>

						<!-- Objective -->
									
									<header>
										<h2>Objectives</h2>
									<p>From the analysis, I am seeking to identify useful insights and validate four key hypotheses against the data, including:
									<ol>
										<li>People travel more in the Winter than in Summer</li>
										<li>People take more trips during the evening</li>
										<li>People tip more on the weekends</li>
										<li>People take longer duration trips on the weekends</li>
									</ol>
						
						<!-- Process -->

									<header>
										<h2>Process</h2>
									<ol>
										<li>Download the primary travel data in .csv format covering the applicable travel types, cab types and months</li>
										<li>Download the supplementary travel data in .csv format covering borough and taxi zone mapping</li>
										<li>Load both datasets into Alteryx Designer and execute the workflow shown below, with following steps:</li>
											<ol>
												<li>Input Data - import the primary travel data into Alteryx Designer</li>
												<li>Data Cleansing - remove NULL from rows, trailing and leading white spaces</li>
												<li>Select - update fields to appropriate data type and rename as applicable</li>
												<li>RecordID - add index to serve as unique identifier for each row</li>
												<li>Formula - calcuate fields such as ride duration, day of week etc.</li>
												<li>Filter - apply filter to return months of February and August 2018 only</li>
												<li>Left Join (2x) - enrich primary data (PickUp and DropOff ID) with location, zone and borough name</li>
												<li>Output Data - export consolidated data into .csv for analysis (with container to switch on/off)</li>

											</ol>
										</ol>

						<!-- Insights -->

									<header>
										<h2>Insights</h2>

									<dl>
										<dt>Hypothesis 1 - People do travel more in Winter than in Summer</dt>
										<dd>
											<ul>
												<li>People in NYC travel more in Winter as opposed to Summer, which is true in both number of trips taken (8.2% higher) and passengers per trip (7.8% higher)</li>
												<li>Number of trips taken are significantly higher on weekends during the Winter (44% and 22% for Saturday and Sunday, respectively) - which could be driven by increased recreational activity during the holiday season</li>
												<li>Interestingly, the total duration of rides was lower in Winter despite number of trips being greater; which may attributable to longer travel times as a result of greater foot and car traffic during the busy working season</li>
											</ul>
										</dd>
										<dt>Hypothesis 2 - People (generally) do not take more trips during the evening</dt>
										<dd>
											<ul>
												<li>People in NYC do not tend to take more trips in the evening (defined as 6:00PM to 6:00AM); approx. 33% more trips were completed during the day</li>
												<li>The hourly distribution of travel paints a different picture, as the volume of trips continue into the early hours (12AM to 3AM) of weekends; which is like attributed to the purpose of trips (recreational, dinner, partying etc.)The hourly distribution of travel paints a different picture, as the volume of trips continue into the early hours (12AM to 3AM) of weekends; which is like attributed to the purpose of trips (recreational, dinner, partying etc.)</li>
												<li>The number of trips dropped off in outer boroughs almost doubles when comparing day and night; giving us further indication that people do travel in the evenings (perhaps for more specific reasons)</li>
											</ul>
										</dd>
										<dt>Hypothesis 3 - People do not tip more (via EFTPOS) on the weekends</dt>
										<dd>
											<ul>
												<li>People in NYC do not tend to tip more on weekends, in both tip per ride and tip per passenger (weekends fall 25% short to weekdays)</li>
												<li>Higher proportion of rides on weekends recorded no tip and is likely related to the TLC data only capturing EFTPOS tips as opposed to cash</li>
												<li>30% of all trips are paid for in cash, and therefore the exclusion of cash tips would have a material impact on our results</li>
											</ul>
										</dd>
										<dt>Hypothesis 4 - People take longer distance (but shorter duration) trips on the weekends</dt>
										<dd>
											<ul>
												<li>People in NYC tend to travel longer distances (miles) but take a shorter or comparable amount of time to complete the trip, which is true across all days of the week</li>
												<li>Short distance trips (0 and 5 miles) accounted for 85% of rides and, on a flows basis, occurs primarily within inner Manhattan</li>
												<li>Duration is less skewed than distance, and this may again lend itself to traffic-related issues experienced within inner Manhattan</li>
											</ul>
