										<h2>Context</h2>
										</header>
						
									<p>In this project, I explore public listing data across four streaming providers, conduct longitudinal analysis over member growth, listings, genres & durations and report on my findings in a dynamic dashboard format. 
									<p>The data is sourced, cleansed and managed by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/datasets" target = "_blank">Shivam Bansal (via Kaggle)</a>. The dashboard covers listing data from inception to 2021 for providers Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus and Hulu.
									<p>Some of the key metrics are defined as:
									<ul>
										<li>'Time To Service' - calculated as the difference between [Date that listing was added to platform] and  [Date that listing was released]</li>
										<li>'Parental Ratings' - refers to the 'Motion Picture Film Rating System' and includes rolled-up data points from each platform</li>
										<li>'Duration' (movies) - grouped as 'Short covers 0 to 60 minutes', 'Moderate covers 61 to 120 minutes' and 'Long covers > 121 minutes'</li>
										<li>'Duration (shows)' - grouped as 'Short covers 1 - 3 seasons', 'Moderate covers 4 to 10 seasons' and 'Long covers > 11 seasons'</li>
									</ul>

						<!-- Objective -->
									
									<header>
										<h2>Objectives</h2>
										</header>
									<p>From the analysis, I aim to report on key trends and insights from the listing data in a dynamic and visual manner; allowing users to filter across provider, listing, genre.</p>
						
						<!-- Process -->

									<header>
										<h2>Process</h2>
									<ol>
										<li>Download the primary listing data in .csv format, covering the four major streaming services (Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime and Hulu)</li>
										<li>Execute the following script in MySQL to load, cleanse and enrich the raw data:</li>

								<dt>Listings & Member Growth</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										<li>People in NYC travel more in Winter as opposed to Summer, which is true in both number of trips taken (8.2% higher) and passengers per trip (7.8% higher)</li>
										<li>Number of trips taken are significantly higher on weekends during the Winter (44% and 22% for Saturday and Sunday, respectively) - which could be driven by increased recreational activity during the holiday season</li>
										<li>Interestingly, the total duration of rides was lower in Winter despite number of trips being greater; which may attributable to longer travel times as a result of greater foot and car traffic during the busy working season</li>
									</ul>
								</dd>
								<dt>Genres & Duration</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										<li>People in NYC do not tend to take more trips in the evening (defined as 6:00PM to 6:00AM); approx. 33% more trips were completed during the day</li>
										<li>The hourly distribution of travel paints a different picture, as the volume of trips continue into the early hours (12AM to 3AM) of weekends; which is like attributed to the purpose of trips (recreational, dinner, partying etc.)The hourly distribution of travel paints a different picture, as the volume of trips continue into the early hours (12AM to 3AM) of weekends; which is like attributed to the purpose of trips (recreational, dinner, partying etc.)</li>
										<li>The number of trips dropped off in outer boroughs almost doubles when comparing day and night; giving us further indication that people do travel in the evenings (perhaps for more specific reasons)</li>
									</ul>
								</dd>
								<dt>Time to Service, Rating & Releases</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										<li>People in NYC do not tend to tip more on weekends, in both tip per ride and tip per passenger (weekends fall 25% short to weekdays)</li>
										<li>Higher proportion of rides on weekends recorded no tip and is likely related to the TLC data only capturing EFTPOS tips as opposed to cash</li>
										<li>30% of all trips are paid for in cash, and therefore the exclusion of cash tips would have a material impact on our results</li>
